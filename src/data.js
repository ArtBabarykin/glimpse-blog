      "Anyone who has spent any time in the home construction industry knows that, while the job can be sweet, it can also be brutal. The housing market has always been volatile, but perhaps never more so than now. And that trend is only expected to continue, as home prices rise and inventories dwindle. That means that if you’re going to thrive in the increasingly competitive housing construction industry, you’re going to need an edge. For a growing number of residential construction firms, that competitive edge rests in the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). But how, exactly, are AR and VR being used in the home construction industry?",

    content:
      "Following last year’s massive spike in online shopping, retailers are considering how to adjust their strategies for Black Friday 2021. Our preference for ecommerce is not a new trend: online shopping has been overtaking in-person shopping for years, forcing retailers to respond to this shift in retail habits. The trend isn’t slowing down either, as over half of shoppers plan to conduct their shopping online for Black Friday 2021. Nonetheless, ecommerce still faces inherent issues which put it at a disadvantage to in-person shopping. The biggest issue for online clothing shopping is the inability to try on, test out, or otherwise “experience” a product before buying it. This leads to a significantly higher rate of returns compared to in-person shopping, costing both customers and companies time and money. By utilizing AR technology, retail companies can reintroduce the “experience” stage of shopping to ecommerce. Virtual fitting room technology enables customers to try on products from home using AR filters, reducing returns and leaning into the broader transition toward shopping online.",

      "Currently, immersive technologies are application-centric and hardware technology is not at a point where it is accessible to all users. As better hardware becomes available, the transformative potential for Virtual and Augmented Reality will be unlocked. Engineers will be needed to innovate current technologies and to bring new ideas and concepts to life. When searching for entry-level positions in VR/AR engineering, you’ll identify many common qualifications. Experience in web application development and immersive technologies, strong communication and critical thinking skills, and an understanding of applications such as Unity, Unreal, and Cryengine are highly desired by companies. Industry specific skills are not typically focused on within general engineering programs, so in order to meet this hiring demand, potential candidates are vying to supplement their knowledge. Our engineers here at The Glimpse Group were interviewed about pursuing employment in the VR/AR industry. Oliviér Morland stated that it is vital to educate yourself relentlessly because …this will allow you to do better work, be less frustrated at work, and even enjoy. It is really the key to progress. You have to read books and take courses in your spare time. Engineers are looking into self-teaching methods to broaden their skill sets in addition to seeking out computer science training. Untraditional options that are available to engineers seeking to specialize their knowledge include online bootcamps. One such bootcamp is XR Terra, a Glimpse subsidiary that provides 12-week XR intensives that are guided by experts. Platforms like this teach the principles of VR/AR development and offer a faster alternative to learning industry specific coding. When asked what advice he would give to emerging engineers, Woodrow Proctor, another engineer here at Glimpse, stated Get interested and try to get your feet into as much VR content/conversation as possible. VR/AR is still a small world so if you pay attention to the developments being made and keep up with the new apps and ideas people are putting out you will be a huge boon when trying to build groundbreaking VR/AR software.",

      "It’s interesting how often technology takes hold of society through entertainment. This has been the route for both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The technology has largely become popular through its association with immersive video games, or the growing world of virtual artwork and interactive filmmaking. Indeed, it’s fair to say the demand for immersive entertainment has helped to spur and fund the development of the technology in a positive way. However, now that VR and AR are available in accessible forms, both in terms of practical applications and lower costs, the scope for its use as a tool in other areas has grown. Various industries are exploring the potential for compatible applications — from virtual conferencing to online real estate tours. Perhaps the most exciting aspects of this are how VR and AR can help our society become more positive, healthy, and successful. Let’s take a closer look at how both of these virtual technologies are making a difference in our world today, and will in the near future.",

      "Today, nonprofits, AKA non-governmental organizations (NGOs), face a challenge — to differentiate themselves from other organizations, and from the rest of the content online, fighting for people’s attention. People tend to respond better to issues they can identify with and that they feel closer to. Virtual Reality (VR) can bridge this gap in presenting different issues while incentivizing people to engage with them. VR gives users the ability to control an avatar, which offers a unique feeling of connection to the world around them. In contrast to traditional media, VR elicits a higher sense of immersion in users. While we can still get absorbed when reading a book or watching a movie, VR blocks out our external environment and presents a substitute for reality. It affords users with a sense of “being there”. Previous research shows that participants’ behavior can be primed after VR experiences. Greater empathy and pro social behavior can be attained, although these effects are not always long term. Nonprofits can take advantage of this by creating stories that help participants understand particular issues better. With the following design principles, nonprofits can achieve greater immersion.",

      "With everything that happened in 2020, it’s no wonder that we find ourselves increasingly stepping into augmented or fully virtual realities (AR and VR). These tools, made popular through headsets like Oculus or Google Glass, are on the rise across industries. Now, even financial industries like big banks are applying AR and VR to great success. Virtual reality tools are being used to achieve everything from data visualization to greater system security in light of a more dangerous digital environment. Whether they’re working from home or in the office, AR and VR allow finance professionals to integrate with fintech like never before. As a result, we’re escaping a pandemic-stricken world for one where data insights are experienceable, where customers can visualize financial products, and banks can improve their services.

      "The hospitality industry has been using AR and VR technologies more and more, as they become more easily accessible. And with guest engagement in this industry, AR and VR tech are a godsend, since they benefit both the healthcare professionals and their patients. Tech writer Allison Hill from Elite Assignment Help and UK Top Writers says, “VR, or virtual reality, allows you to experience a world that isn’t real with 360 degree video. AR, or augmented reality, overlays info and graphics over a real environment. These two technologies are similar in their end goals, but are used differently. With that in mind, it’s important to know the difference, before thinking about how you’ll use them. So, if you’re looking to implement them in your business though, what’s the best way of doing so? There are several different ways you can use them to improve guest engagement. Here are just a few ways you can use them.",

      "When the COVID-19 pandemic stuck, many of us transitioned rapidly to remote work. Now, since most of us are stuck in our makeshift home offices, the potential of virtual reality experiences in business is more alluring than ever before. This phenomenal growth industry represents an endless potential for innovation and data visualization.The global VR market is expected to reach $12 billion in value by 2024 which contrasts greatly with its less than $5 billion value in 2021. Because of the value VR brings to business opportunities, companies across industries are experimenting with its application in new areas. In business analytics, this means new avenues for seeing and understanding data and customer experiences. VR enhances business analytics by offering a host of benefits and insights. That’s why modern companies are increasingly adopting the medium in their analytics processes to reap the benefits in a variety of ways.",
